## Context resolution

`<plugin root>` is the folder two levels above this `SKILL.md`; `<plugin root>/...` paths are relative to it.

1. Before any answer, even a quick one: use the profiles the user names, else those bound in `hep-research.project.json` at the project root; read a bound profile before answering about its experiment. Never infer an experiment or a model from vague wording; if a needed profile cannot be determined, ask which one.
2. Only when a profile is needed, read `<plugin root>/profiles/registry.json`, then that profile's `index.md`, then only the modules or dataset records the task needs. Never load an unrelated experiment or theory profile.
3. Local profiles live in the project (`local_profile_paths`), never in the plugin; check them with `python3 "<plugin root>/contracts/project.py" <project-dir>`. A bound profile found in neither place may come from a companion plugin: load the installed `<plugin>:profile` skill that names it and use the folder it gives as a local profile. If none is installed, or a non-public local or companion profile lacks `agent_policy` approval for this host (none has it yet), say the profile is unavailable; never answer its topics from memory.
4. No profile needed: use general methods. Domain without a validated profile (for example lattice QCD, EFT global fits, cosmic-ray propagation): say so, then apply this skill's general discipline.
5. Durable results and handoffs are files in the project's `artifacts_dir` (default `./hep-research-artifacts/`), never in the plugin; check them with `python3 "<plugin root>/contracts/validate.py" <artifact.json>`. Keep every status label (`synthetic`, `asimov`, `observed`, `preliminary`, `failed`, `unvalidated`, `user-supplied`) on everything derived from it.
6. Answer in the user's language; keep artifact fields, identifiers and file names in English.
